## 💡 How to Use beautiful-mermaid-swift

Here is how you can start using the app once installed.

### For End Users (Viewing Diagrams)

1. Open the app on your device.
2. You will see a text entry box and a preview window.
3. Type or paste Mermaid diagram code into the text box.
4. The app automatically renders the diagram in the preview area.
5. Adjust the code as needed to change the diagram.
6. You can save diagrams locally for later reference.

Example of simple Mermaid code to try:

```
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

This shows a flowchart where node A points to B and C, which both lead to D.  

### For Developers (Integrating Renderer)

- Import the package as an SPM dependency.
- Use the provided APIs or SwiftUI views to render Mermaid syntax in your app.
- Customize styles or enable user editing if desired.
